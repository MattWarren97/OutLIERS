# OutLIERS

## A Data Visualisation Project on the Importance (or Unimportance) of Mental Greatness in Professional Sports.

Designed by Matt Warren, using D3.js

## Story

When we watch sports, we like watching winners. We attach stories to them, stories of greatness, of **mental toughness**, of **resistance to pressure**. 

It's a narrative that really plays well for *humans*, because we have a winner's complex. 

We like watching winners.

In this project, I want to see what The Data thinks about our champions, their performances under pressure, and their performances in its absence.

## Project Structure

For each visualisation, the output is a HTML page in the main directory.

- Code to produce visuals in 	```/viz/```
- css in 						```/styles/```
- Code used to collect data in 	```/collectData/```
